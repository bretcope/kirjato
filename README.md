# Kirjato

Node.js blogging platform work in progress... nothing to see here yet.

## It's called what?

_Pronounced `/kɪərˈʒɑ toʊ/` (or keer-ja-tow, where the ja sounds like the ge in beige or the s in measure)_

__And why is it called that?__ It was either that or Popplers. All other names were taken. Also, it happens to be a truncation of the word kirjatoimetaja meaning "scribe" in Estonian, though Estonians would pronounce it slightly differently.
